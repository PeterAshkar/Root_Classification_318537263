1) Defining the conditions incorrectly:

- Replacing Two_roots with Error
- Changing Equal_roots to Two_roots
- Replacing Not_quadratic with Equal_roots
- Changing Not_quadratic to No_roots
- Changing Equal_roots to Not_quadratic

2) Writing the function incorrectly

- Changing the product from 2 to 4 in the formula


3) Setting the ranges incorrectly

- The ranges should all be equal to [0-100] according to the presentation
